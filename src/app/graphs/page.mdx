# Binary Search

Very commonly people think binary search is just to find the index of a target value in a sorted array.
But it have much more applications than that Lets find out.

### What is Binary Search?

In short, Binary Search is a searching algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a sorted array.
The advantage of binary search over linear search is that binary search is much faster.
In binary search, we do not check every element of the array, we ***only*** check log<sub>2</sub> n elements.

Why do we care about log<sub>2</sub> n elements? Because log<sub>2</sub> n is much smaller than n.
For example, if the array is sorted and has 1 billion elements, we only need to check 30 elements (at worst case) to find the target value using binary search.
But, if we use linear search, we need to check all 1 billion elements (at worst case) to find the target value.
It is very clear that it will take much less time to check 30 elements than 1 billion elements.

## Sort by \*what\* ?

The array must be sorted in order to use binary search. But, sorted by what?
The common thought is ***sorted by value***. But, the power of binary search is that it can be sorted by anything.

How can we sort an array by anything other than value?
Instead of an array of values, we can sort an array by asking the question ***is the element even or odd?***.
If the element is even, we put it in the right side of the array. If the element is odd, we put it in the left side of the array.
This way, we can sort an array by even and odd.

```python
array = [ 9, 3, 13, 21, 8, 4, 16]
```

The array above is sorted by even and odd. The even numbers are on the left side of the array and the odd numbers are on the right side of the array.
The idea is not new at all. When we implement any sort algorithm, we need to compare two elements and swap them if they are not in the correct order.
And the comparison is not always about value. We can compare two elements by anything we want.

For more information about sorting by anything, you read about the ***compartor***  function.

Almost all programming language have a sort function that takes a comparator function as an argument.

Here's an example of sorting an array by even and odd in python.

```python
array = [ 2,3,1,3,8,9,12,6]
array.sort(key=lambda x: x % 2)
print(array)
```

The output is

```python
[2, 8, 12, 6, 3, 1, 3, 9]
```
